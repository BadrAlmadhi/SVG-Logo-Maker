# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description 

This SVG logo creator is built on a foundation of Node.js, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Jest for testing. Initially, grasping the concepts of OOP posed a challenge, but as comprehension deepened, the code became significantly more organized and reusable. The project is designed as an interactive command-line tool that guides users through a series of questions to create their desired shape.

The integration of the inquirer library enhances interactivity, making the prompt dynamic and user-friendly. Leveraging Node.js, the application generates the SVG file efficiently, utilizing the writeFile() method. This approach not only streamlines the process of shape creation but also ensures the scalability and maintainability of the codebase. OOP principles play a pivotal role in structuring the code, fostering modularity, and improving overall code quality.

Incorporating Jest for testing ensures the reliability and correctness of the codebase, allowing for seamless development and future enhancements. This project serves as a testament to the synergy between Node.js, OOP, and Jest, creating a robust and user-friendly SVG logo creator with a well-organized and maintainable code structure.
